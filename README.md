# libxlsx - Surgical XLSX Editor

**libxlsx** is a Python library for making surgical edits to existing Excel (.xlsx) files while preserving all original formatting, charts, pivot tables, macros, and advanced features.

## Why libxlsx?

Traditional Excel libraries try to parse and recreate entire workbooks, often losing complex formatting and advanced features in the process. This approach requires implementing Excel's vast feature setâ€”essentially rebuilding Excel itself.

**libxlsx takes a different approach**: it loads the entire XLSX file into memory and makes only targeted, surgical modifications to specific cells while leaving everything else byte-for-byte identical. This ensures complete fidelity with the original workbook.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install libxlsx
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from libxlsx import load_workbook, formula
from libxlsx.const import *

# Load existing workbook (preserves everything)
workbook = load_workbook("report.xlsx")
sheet = workbook["Sheet1"]

# Read values
revenue = sheet[A][1]  # Get cell A1
print(f"Current revenue: {revenue}")

# Write values (only these cells are modified)
sheet[A][1] = 125000.0        # Update revenue
sheet[B][1] = "Updated"        # Add status
sheet[C][1] = formula("=A1*1.1")  # Add 10% projection

# Save with minimal changes
workbook.save("report_updated.xlsx")
```

### Real-World Example

```python
from libxlsx import load_workbook, formula
from libxlsx.const import *

# Update a financial model without breaking formulas/charts
model = load_workbook("financial_model.xlsx")
assumptions = model["Assumptions"]

# Update key assumptions (formulas elsewhere will recalculate)
assumptions[B][5] = 0.15    # Growth rate
assumptions[B][6] = 0.25    # Tax rate
assumptions[B][7] = 1000000 # Base revenue

# Add validation formula
assumptions[B][10] = formula("=IF(B5>0.5,\"Check growth rate\",\"OK\")")

# All charts, pivot tables, and complex formulas remain intact
model.save("financial_model_updated.xlsx")
```

## API Design

The following code examples demonstrate the intended API design and functionality:

```python

from libxlsx import load_workbook, formula
from libxlsx.const import *

workbook = load_workbook("Workbook.xlsx")

sheet = workbook["Sheet1"]


# column + row access
sheet[A][1] = 123.45
sheet[A][2] = "Hello world"
sheet[B][1] = formula("=SUM(B2:B8)")


x: str = sheet[A][2]

for row in sheet[A]:
    print(row)
# -> 123.45
# -> "Hello world"

len(sheet[A])
# -> 2


for row in sheet[A][1:2]:
    print(row)
# -> 123.45
# -> "Hello world"


for col in sheet[A:B]:
    for cell in col:
        print(cell)
# -> 123.45
# -> "Hello world"
# -> =SUM(B2:B8)


workbook.save("Workbook (modified).xlsx")
```
